# Enhancing Blind Assistance Applications with Optical Neural Networks:

The current research explores the use of 
optical neural networks, which utilise photons for concurrent 
processing, as an innovative way to significantly shorten the 
blind person's reaction time. These optical neural networks 
are able to process visual input 3000 times faster than 
conventional neural networks, utilising the speed advantages 
of photons over electrons.
Optical neural networks offer the potential to be life-saving 
in life-threatening situations, when every moment counts. 
Their rapid response time and object detection capabilities 
enable blind individuals to navigate safely and 
independently through emergency situations and hazards, 
avoiding potential accidents and guiding them to safety.
